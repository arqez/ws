	<h7>This is a Discord nuke bot which is written in discord.py. It's very easy to use, and you can self-host it, or host it from a site like repl.it.</h7>

	<h7>Keep in mind, this is NOT a selfbot.</h7>

<h1 align="center">Also</h1>
<p>i suck at discord.py but im trying to improve, so i will add stuff here from time to time</p>

usage:

$ccr - creates channels

$cdel - deletes all channels

$nuke - deletes all existing channels, and makes a bunch of new ones

$spam - sends a message in every channel multiple times. if you want to make this faster, spam the command each 3 seconds or so, and it will speed up as channel creation progresses
